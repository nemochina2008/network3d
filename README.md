# Network3d

A small and fast 3d network visualization and layout library. Uses webgl and javascript to not only visualize your networks in 3d but also to perform the physics simulation responsible for finding an optimal layout. 

Installation instructions and examples coming soon!


## Notes

You can either give your vertices df a size column which will size your point diameters in the context of a 2x2x2 cube environment or you can define a default point size which will be applied to every node. If you have supplied a size column this will take presidence over the default size setting.
